diskover-web is an open source web file manager, disk space usage, storage analytics and file search engine for [diskover](https://github.com/shirosaidev/diskover). It is designed to help you quickly search across your storage servers using your diskover Elasticsearch indices. With diskover-web you can visualize the file system meta data from your diskover crawls and get better insights into your data by viewing detailed disk usage analytics of your file systems.

diskover-web also supports file and directory tagging. Files and directories can be tagged for keep, archive or delete, or with custom tags, and from there you can use the diskover-web API to access file info for any data moving you wish to do.

With "smartsearches" in diskover-web, you can create any ES query and visualize those queries using the smartsearch analytics. Included are some common search queries such as image files, audio, video, documents, etc.

diskover-web allows exporting of file lists to json/csv, also the diskover-web REST API can be integrated into your pipeline and used to view or update data, such as tags, in your diskover indices.

It is written in HTML5, CSS3, PHP, Javascript, [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [D3.js](https://d3js.org).
